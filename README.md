# Elevate Labs Internship

This repository contains my work for the 1 month Elevate Labs Internship. Each folder documents a different task or project I completed during the internship, along with my notes, results, and what I learned.

## Contents

- [`task-1`](task-1/): Scanning my local network for open ports using Nmap. Includes step-by-step workflow, results, and key takeaways.
- _(I'll add more tasks as I complete them, today was the first day of my internship.)_

## About this repo

- Each task folder has its own `README.md` with a summary of what I learned.
- For detailed steps, screenshots, and raw outputs, check the `workflow.md` and result files inside each task folder.
