# Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

This task involved conducting a comprehensive security audit of my browser extensions to identify potential security risks and maintain good browser hygiene. I learned how to evaluate extension legitimacy, understand permission risks, and make informed decisions about which extensions to keep, disable, or remove.

## Key Concepts I Explored

- **Extension Security Evaluation:**  
  Learned how to assess browser extensions for legitimacy by checking developer reputation, user reviews, and permission requirements.

- **Permission Analysis:**  
  Understood what different extension permissions mean and why some extensions require broad access to function properly.

- **Risk vs. Utility Assessment:**  
  Evaluated each extension based on actual usage frequency versus potential security exposure to make informed decisions.

- **Browser Hygiene Best Practices:**  
  Discovered the importance of regular extension audits and the principle of least privilege for browser security.

- **Malicious Extension Tactics:**  
  Researched how malicious extensions exploit users through data theft, ad injection, browser hijacking, and social engineering.

## My Key Findings

- **Legitimate Extensions Require Broad Permissions:** Tools like Bitwarden (password manager) and GoFullPage (screen capture) legitimately need "access to all websites" to function
- **Unused Extensions Pose Unnecessary Risk:** The Coinbase Wallet Extension, while legitimate, was disabled since it's rarely used and represents unnecessary attack surface
- **Developer Reputation Matters:** All reviewed extensions (Bitwarden, Coinbase, GoFullPage) had high ratings (4.7-4.9 stars) and positive community feedback
- **Brave Browser Security:** Using Brave Browser provides additional security layers while maintaining Chrome extension compatibility
- **Regular Audits Are Essential:** Even legitimate extensions should be periodically reviewed for continued necessity

## My Takeaways

- Browser extension security isn't just about avoiding malicious software - it's about managing your overall digital attack surface by only keeping extensions you actively use.
- High-permission extensions from reputable developers can be safe, but each one increases potential risk and should be justified by actual utility.
- The disable option is valuable for extensions you might need occasionally but don't want running constantly in the background.
- Understanding extension permissions helps make informed security decisions rather than blindly accepting installations.
- Regular extension audits should be part of routine cybersecurity hygiene, just like updating software and reviewing passwords.
