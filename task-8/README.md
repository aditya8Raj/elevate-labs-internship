# Task 8: Working with VPNs

This task involved setting up and testing a VPN service to understand how VPNs protect privacy and secure communications. I used Windscribe VPN on Arch Linux, successfully verified IP address changes, and analyzed VPN benefits and limitations.

## Key Concepts I Explored

- **VPN Functionality:**  
  Learned how VPNs route traffic through encrypted tunnels to hide real IP addresses and locations.

- **Privacy Verification:**  
  Tested IP address changes before/after VPN connection to confirm location masking works effectively.

- **Geographic IP Changes:**  
  Successfully changed apparent location from India to France, demonstrating geo-spoofing capabilities.

## My Key Findings

- **Successful IP Masking:** Changed from Indian IP (49.47.132.219) to French IP (138.199.47.207) via Windscribe
- **Windscribe Performance:** Free tier provides 10GB monthly data with good connection stability
- **Privacy Enhancement:** VPN effectively hides real location and ISP from websites and services

## My Takeaways

- VPNs are essential tools for privacy protection, especially on public networks and for bypassing geo-restrictions.
- Free VPN tiers have limitations but are sufficient for understanding VPN functionality and basic privacy needs.
- Regular IP verification is important to ensure VPN connections are working properly.
