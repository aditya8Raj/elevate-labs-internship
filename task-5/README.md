# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic with Wireshark

This task involved using Wireshark to capture and analyze live network traffic on my system. I learned how to identify different network protocols, filter packet data, and understand the types of traffic generated by common internet activities like web browsing and network diagnostics.

## Key Concepts I Explored

- **Packet Capture:**  
  Learned how Wireshark captures network packets in real-time, providing visibility into all traffic flowing through a network interface.

- **Protocol Identification:**  
  Identified and analyzed multiple network protocols including HTTP, DNS, TCP, and ICMP through practical filtering and examination.

- **Traffic Generation:**  
  Generated diverse network traffic using common tools like `curl`, `ping`, `nslookup`, and `dig` to create realistic data for analysis.

- **Wireshark Filtering:**  
  Mastered basic Wireshark filters (`http`, `dns`, `tcp`, `icmp`) to isolate specific protocol traffic and analyze packet counts and characteristics.

- **Protocol Analysis:**  
  Analyzed TCP three-way handshakes, DNS resolution processes, HTTP requests/responses, and ICMP ping operations in captured traffic.

## My Key Findings

- **Traffic Distribution:** Captured 416 total packets with TCP representing the majority (338 packets, 81.3%) of network traffic
- **Protocol Diversity:** Successfully identified 4 different protocols: TCP, HTTP, DNS, and ICMP
- **Real-world Patterns:** Observed that most web traffic uses HTTPS (port 443) rather than HTTP (port 80) for security
- **Network Diagnostics:** ICMP packets directly corresponded to our ping commands, demonstrating how diagnostic tools generate specific traffic patterns

## My Takeaways

- Wireshark provides incredible visibility into network communications that are normally invisible to users.
- Even simple activities like web browsing generate complex protocol interactions involving DNS lookups, TCP connections, and HTTP/HTTPS requests.
- Understanding network protocols helps in troubleshooting connectivity issues and identifying potential security threats.
- Packet analysis skills are fundamental for network security monitoring and incident response.
