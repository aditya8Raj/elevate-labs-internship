# Task 3: Perform a Basic Vulnerability Scan on Your PC

This task involved using Nessus Essentials to perform a vulnerability scan on my local machine. I documented the installation, setup, scanning process, and analyzed the results to identify critical security issues.

## Key Concepts I Explored

- **Vulnerability Scanning:**  
  Learned how automated tools like Nessus can detect security flaws in systems and software.

- **Nessus Essentials:**  
  Installed and configured Nessus, a widely used vulnerability scanner, and explored its web interface.

- **Scan Configuration:**  
  Set up a basic network scan targeting `127.0.0.1` (localhost) to analyze my own system.

- **Result Analysis:**  
  Interpreted scan results, focusing on critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, and researched recommended remediations.

## My Takeaways

- Vulnerability scanners are essential for identifying weaknesses before attackers do.
- Even a basic scan can reveal critical issues like outdated software (e.g., Apache Log4j) and potential Denial of Service risks.
- Regular scanning and prompt remediation are key to maintaining a secure system.
