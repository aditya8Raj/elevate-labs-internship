# 1. Installing Nessus Essentials

### For this task, I chose to use **Nessus Essentials** as my vulnerability scanning tool.

### I downloaded it from the official Tenable website:

[https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus)

### I'm using Kali linux in VM, so I selected the version for **Linux** and followed the installation instructions provided on the site.

### After downloading, I went through the installation instructions given on [https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/InstallNessusLinux.htm](https://docs.tenable.com/nessus/Content/InstallNessusLinux.htm) and I installed the downloaded package using the following command:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i Nessus-10.8.4-ubuntu1604_amd64.deb
```

### I then started the Nessus service with:

```bash
sudo systemctl start nessusd
```

### Then I opened my web browser and navigated to `https://localhost:8834/` to access the Nessus web interface.

### I was prompted to create an account, so I filled in the required details and created a user account.

### After that, I was asked to enter an activation code. I obtained the activation code from the Tenable website after registering for Nessus Essentials.

### After doing all of this, I was able to log in to the Nessus web interface.

### Initially, Nessus took some time to update its plugins and configurations.

# 2. Setting Up the Vulnerability Scan

### Once Nessus was running on the web interface, I followed these steps:

1. Clicked "New Scan"

2. Selected "Basic Network Scan" option

3. Set target to my **localhost**:

```bash
127.0.0.1
```

4. Named the scan "Scanning my localhost"

# 5. Documenting the most critical vulnerabilities.

### As this was my first vulnerability scan using Nessus, it was a bit confusing to navigate through the results. So, I exported the scan result and gave it to <u>ChatGPT</u> to analyze the critical and high-severity vulnerabilities.

### Below are the top issues detected:
